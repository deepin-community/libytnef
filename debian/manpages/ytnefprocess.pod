=head1 NAME

ytnefprocess - process TNEF MIME parts in standard input

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ytnefprocess> < I<mailfile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the B<ytnefprocess> program.

This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.

B<ytnefprocess> is a command line utility which allows processing of
TNEF attachments (also known as F<winmail.dat> attachments) contained in
MIME parts read from standard input.

This can be useful to process messages from a mail reader which has
no native TNEF support, but is able to pipe messages to other tools.

The TNEF attachments found are replaced by the attached files existing
in the I<winmail.dat> cointainer.

=head1 FILES
